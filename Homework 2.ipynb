Nevertheless, for many questions you are expected to take decisions on some steps of the analysis the way humans do. Also, I have already tried to let ChatGPT solve this homework and what I got was not wrong, but rarely was the right solutions I am expecting from you. I ask you not to use any rolling window out-of-the-box functions for a specific reason i.e., you don't often know what it is under the hood of those. That is very dangerous, you should always be in full control.\n",
